## Start to work (maybe)

Don't know really what to say, I guessed it's the same for all at the start.
Maybe I'll have a job in a few weeks. This could be a way to keep track of what I am doing and how I am feeling. I do not have to forgot what is important. Money are not important (if you can have a decent life with the ones you are making). Prestige is not important, fame is not important.
Shit person go to the search of power over people.
Knowledge is important. You got to work on this unachievable goal: to know everything. Let's see how far I can go.
